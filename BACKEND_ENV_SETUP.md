## üéØ What This Does:

‚úÖ **Switches from Resend to Gmail** (more reliable)
‚úÖ **Sends you the contact form submission**
‚úÖ **Automatically sends the sender a professional thank you email**
‚úÖ **Works with your existing Gmail account**

## üîç Troubleshooting:

### If emails aren't sending:

1. **Check Vercel logs:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/pravins-projects-aec234d3/backend/logs
   - Look for error messages

2. **Verify environment variables are set:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/pravins-projects-aec234d3/backend/settings/environment-variables
   - Make sure all 3 variables are there with green checkmarks

3. **Check Gmail settings:**
   - Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled
   - Make sure the App Password is correct (no spaces)

4. **Check spam folder:**
   - The automated email might be in spam initially

---

## üìå Important Notes:

- **The App Password is NOT your Gmail password**
- **Keep the App Password secure** - treat it like a password
- **The automated email will come FROM your Gmail** (pravinsurya2905@gmail.com)
- **Both you and the sender will receive emails** after each form submission
