# 🚀 Serverless Email with Resend + Vercel Functions

## ✅ What I've Created

You now have a **100% serverless** email solution using:
- **Vercel Serverless Functions** (runs on Vercel's edge network)
- **Resend API** (modern email service)
- **No backend server needed!**

---

## 📁 What Changed

### 1. Created `/api/contact.js`
- Vercel serverless function (runs on demand)
- Uses Resend to send emails
- Sends 2 emails:
  - One to you (the portfolio owner)
  - One auto-reply to the sender

### 2. Updated `ContactEnhanced.js`
- Now calls `/api/contact` (serverless function)
- No more external backend needed

### 3. Added `resend` to `package.json`
- Installed Resend package
