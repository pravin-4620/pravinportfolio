# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Check Your Vercel Environment Variables NOW!

The backend code has been updated, but emails won't work until you add the environment variables.

## üîç Quick Check:

### 1. Open your Backend Vercel Dashboard:
Click this link: **https://vercel.com/pravins-projects-aec234d3/backend/settings/environment-variables**

(If that doesn't work, go to https://vercel.com ‚Üí Find "backend" or "Portfoliobackend" project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables)

---

## 2. Do you see these 3 variables?

‚úÖ **EMAIL_USER** (should be: pravinsurya2905@gmail.com)
‚úÖ **EMAIL_PASS** (should be: 16-character app password)
‚úÖ **RECEIVER_EMAIL** (should be: pravinsurya2905@gmail.com)

## ‚úÖ If you DO see these variables:

4. Submit
5. **Check YOUR inbox** - you should get the thank you email
6. **Check your Gmail sent folder** - you should see the sent emails

## üîç Still Not Working?

### Check Vercel Logs:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/pravins-projects-aec234d3/backend
2. Click on the latest deployment
