# 🔧 Contact Form Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: "Failed to send message"

The backend is running, but emails are failing. This is **99% likely** an environment variable issue on Render.

---

## ✅ Quick Fix Checklist

### Step 1: Verify Render Environment Variables

1. **Go to your Render dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Click on your backend service** (`pravin-portfolio-backend`)
3. **Click "Environment"** tab on the left
4. **Verify ALL 4 variables exist**:

| Key | What to Check | Common Issues |
|-----|---------------|---------------|
| `EMAIL_USER` | Must be your **full Gmail address** | ❌ Missing `@gmail.com` |
| `EMAIL_PASS` | Must be **16-character App Password** (with or without spaces) | ❌ Using regular Gmail password<br>❌ Using old/revoked app password |
| `RECEIVER_EMAIL` | Your Gmail address where you want emails | ❌ Typo in email |
| `NODE_ENV` | Must be `production` | Usually OK |

---

### Step 2: Verify Gmail App Password (MOST COMMON ISSUE!)

#### ⚠️ Are you using an App Password or your regular Gmail password?

**You MUST use a Gmail App Password, not your regular password!**

#### How to Get/Verify Your App Password:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication first**:
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Find "2-Step Verification"
   - Enable it if not already enabled

2. **Create a NEW App Password**:
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" as the app
   - Select "Other" as device, type: `Portfolio Backend`
   - Click "Generate"
   - **COPY the 16-character password** (looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

3. **Update on Render**:
   - Go to Render dashboard → Your service → Environment tab
   - Find `EMAIL_PASS`
   - Click "Edit"
   - Paste the NEW app password
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - **Backend will auto-redeploy** (wait 2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Common Environment Variable Mistakes

#### ❌ Wrong: Using regular Gmail password
```
EMAIL_PASS = yourGmailPassword123
```

#### ✅ Correct: Using 16-character App Password
```
EMAIL_PASS = abcdefghijklmnop
```
or with spaces:
```
EMAIL_PASS = abcd efgh ijkl mnop
```

#### ❌ Wrong: Partial email address
```
EMAIL_USER = myemail
```

#### ✅ Correct: Full Gmail address
```
EMAIL_USER = myemail@gmail.com
```

## 🧪 Testing After Fixing

1. Wait 2-3 minutes after updating environment variables
2. Go to: https://pravin-peach.vercel.app
3. Scroll to Contact section
4. Fill out the form
5. Click "Send Message"
6. ✅ Should show success message

### Method 2: Check Render Logs
1. Go to Render dashboard → Your service
2. Click "Logs" tab
3. Look for errors related to email sending
4. Common errors:
   - `Invalid login` = Wrong EMAIL_USER or EMAIL_PASS
   - `Authentication failed` = Need App Password, not regular password

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Render Environment Variable Check

### 1. Go to Render Dashboard
```
https://dashboard.render.com
```

### 2. Find Your Service
- Look for `pravin-portfolio-backend` (or whatever you named it)
- Click on it

### 3. Click "Environment" Tab
- You should see this on the left sidebar

### 4. Verify Each Variable

**Check that you have EXACTLY these 4 variables:**

```
EMAIL_USER = your.email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS = your-16-char-app-password
RECEIVER_EMAIL = your.email@gmail.com
NODE_ENV = production
```

### 5. Edit if Needed
- Click the "Edit" button next to any variable

## 📧 Gmail Settings to Check

### 1. Less Secure App Access (Old Gmail)
- This is **DEPRECATED** - don't use this
- Use App Passwords instead

### 2. 2-Factor Authentication
- **MUST be enabled** to create App Passwords
- Check at: https://myaccount.google.com/security

### 3. App Passwords Page
- Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
- You should see your created app passwords here
- If you don't see any, create a new one
