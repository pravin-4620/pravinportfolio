# Receiver Email (where you want to receive contact form submissions)

# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Replace 'your.email@gmail.com' with your actual Gmail address
# 2. For EMAIL_PASS, you need to create a Gmail App Password:
#    - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
#    - Sign in to your Google Account
#    - Select "Mail" as the app
#    - Select "Other" as the device and give it a name (e.g., "Portfolio Contact")
#    - Click "Generate"
#    - Copy the 16-character password and paste it here
#
# 3. If using a different email service (not Gmail):
#    - Change the 'service' in server.js to your provider (e.g., 'outlook', 'yahoo')
#    - Or use SMTP settings directly
#
# 4. Never commit this .env file to version control!
